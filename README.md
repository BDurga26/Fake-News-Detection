The algorithms used are Logistic Regression with an accuracy of 92%.<br />
Decision Tree with an accuracy of 79%.<br />
Random forest with an accuracy of 89%<br />
Naive bayes with an accuracy of 82%.<br />
Passive Agressive with an accuracy of 93%<br />
SVM with an accuracy of 94%.<br />
The SVM model is saved using joblib as it gets highest accuracy and vector file which is used to convert text to numerics.<br />
