# Fake-News-Detection
This project aims to find whether the given news is real or fake by using Machine learning Algorithms.
Algorithms used and their accuracy values:

1.Logistic Regression (92%)
2.Decision Tree (79%)
3.Random Forest(89%)
4.Naive Bayes(82%)
5.Passive Aggressor(93%)
6.SVM(94%)

The SVM Model got highest accuracy, so that model is saved by using Joblib to predict user input. We saved two models, they are:
1.SVM Model -- This is used to predict user input
2.Vector---- This is used to convert text to numerics
